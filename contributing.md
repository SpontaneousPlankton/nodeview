How to Contribute
====================

Thanks for contributing! Please read the following guidlines before submitting a PR.

## Getting Started
- Create a [Github](https://www.google.com) account if you do not already have one 
- Submit an issue if one has not already been created
- Fork the repo
- `npm install`

## Style Guide
 We use ES6 and follow the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). `npm run lint` to check your syntax for errors. It may help to install a linter in your editor of choice.

## Testing
Submit unit tests for full code coverage. We use [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) with [react-test-utils](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html). All code must be in ES6. `npm run mocha` runs the backend tests and `npm test-karma` runs the front end tests.

## Submitting Changes
- Write all your changes on a new branch
- Run `npm test` and make sure all tests pass
- Use clear, concise commit messages
- Ensure that the PR message explains the problem and solution
